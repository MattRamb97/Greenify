# PowerApp
Each home appliance has a unique electronic fingerprint. We would like to create an algorithm that detect the energy use of your main appliances in real-time. Allowing you to understand and optimise your energy use while reducing your environmental impact. Your sensor will start recording your appliance use in the app moments after installation and activation.
